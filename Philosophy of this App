1. Coordinate Systems:
	
	1) Window Coords:

		The coordinates of the fltk window, given by fltk functions.

	2) Drawing Coords:

		The coordinates for our drawing area, defined x: 0.0 to 1.0; y: 0.0 to 1.0.

	3) Data Coords:

		The coordinates for data (displayed as histograms) we read in, defined x to be x-data range and y to be y-data range.

		When there's no read in data, the x and y are set to range 0.0 to 1.0.

	4) Colormap Coords:

		The coordinates for the range of data we want colormap to apply to.

		By default, it is set to the same as Data Coords.

		Also, (mainly for Y axis) if we want to separate alpha scaling from other colors, we need 2 sets of Y coordinates.

	5) Display Coords:

		i) For x: 

			The coordinates for histograms and colormap shown. This can help us decide which part of the histograms and colormaps combined we want to display in the drawing area.

			The coordinate range is a subset of x Data range (data x coords).

			By default, it is set to the same as Data Coords.

		ii) For y:

			A little different because we have separate coords for histograms and colormap. This is for us to implement zooming effects respectively on histograms and on colormap.

			a) The coordinate range for colormap is a subset of y Data range (data y coords) and by default, it is set to the same as Data Coords.

			b) The coordinate range for histogram is a subset of y Data range (data y coords) and by default, it is set to the same as Data Coords.
